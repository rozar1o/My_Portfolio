                    participate in national and international photography exhibitions and bring prizes which portray their passion 
                    and talent for photography. In addition, the club organizes photo walk, picnic, club tour and photo discussions
                    so that club members can get some on-field experience, remain active and bond with each other. Every year this
                    club arranges their signature exhibition, ’Tale of the Darkroom’, National Photography Exhibition, where 
                    enthusiast photographers from all over the country participate. AIUBPC aims to gather photography lovers &
                    enthusiast photographers in one place, developing photography skills by workshops, photo walk and photo
